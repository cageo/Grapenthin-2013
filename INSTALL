How to install CrusDe
=====================

NOTE: The current version needs a little more attention than the convenient
'configure-make-make install' cycle. This will change as soon as possible. In 
the meantime I ask you to hang in there and go through the procedures 
described below. I appreciate your patience!

1) solve dependencies and install the following packages:
    * FFTW3
    * gsl 
    * netCDF
    * Qt -  after installation go to /usr/local/Trolltech and add a 
            symbolic link 'Qt' that points to the directory where the 
            installed version of Qt lives
    * xerces-c

    links at http://www.gps.alaska.edu/ronni/projects/crusde/download.html

    Preferably all these packages should end up in their default directories 
    or /usr/local respectively.

    If you compiled the shared versions set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable in 
    your profile file and add the paths to the respective PACKAGE/lib 
    directory.

2) move and decompress CrusDe (if you read this, you probably already 
   decompressed :) ... move the directory then
    $> cp crusde-VERSION.tar.gz /usr/local
    $> cd /usr/local
    $> tar xfz crusde-VERSION.tar.gz

    If you don't want to install to /usr/local you can move the directory to any
    other place. Whereever it ends up, set this path in your profile file 
    (bash):

	export CRUSDE_HOME=/usr/local/CrusDe

3) go to ./libs/geographiclib and install it by following their INSTALL 
   instructions. This library is for future releases. This should work:
    $> cd $CRUSDE_HOME/libs/geographiclib
    $> make
    
4) edit Makefile
    $> cd $CRUSDE_HOME/src
    $> vi Makefile

    Now several things might have to be changed:
         - Binary directory if you don't have write permission to /usr/local/bin, 
           change
		BIN := <path to where the crusde binary should go>
         - If Qt ended up somewhere different from /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt, 
           change
                export QT_DIR := <path to where Qt is installed>
         - If any of the other libraries is installed somewhere else than 
           /usr/local/{lib | include}, add the respective paths to 
                INCLUDE_DIRS and LIB_DIRS 
           using -I<path> or -L<path> respectively. Those variables already 
           point to /usr/local/xerces-c. Modify this path, if xerces lives in 
           a different directory.
         
5) compile source
     $> cd $CRUSDE_HOME/src
     $> make all

6) install the plug-ins
     Try running:

     $> cd $CRUSDE_HOME/src
     $> install_plugins.sh

     This should automatically install the standard plug-ins. If it doesn't work, 
     follow the long procedure that was in place before this script:
     
     This step might be a little painful, but also helps to familiarize with
     the plug-in manager; there's always a good side to everything, right?!

     $> crusde -p
     
     A little window will open, the so called 'CrusDe Plugin Manager', do the
     following:
         - click 'Add'
         - go to 'src/plugin-src/green'
         - click on 'pinel_hs_elastic.so', click on 'Open'
         - Read text and press 'Ok'
     
     The plugin 'elastic halfspace (pinel)' should be installed in the category
     'green' after some tests were run. 

     Repeat this for all subdirectories in $CRUSDE_HOME/src/plugin_src. Some 
     plugins depend on others and hence a certain order must be followed. Here
     is a recommendation:
         - crustal_decay: free choice (exponential, exponential_rate)
         - data_handler:  free choice (netcdf, table)
         - green:         pinel_hs_elastic.so, pinel_hs_thickplate.so, 
                          pinel_hs_final_relaxed.so,pinel_inverse_thickplate.so
         - load:          free choice (disk, irregular)
         - load_history:  free choice
         - operator:      fast_conv.so, fast_conv_time_space.so (conv.so is 
                          useless at the moment)
         - postprocess:   free choice

     A known problem is that plug-ins that depend on other plug-ins will cause 
     the plugin manager to crash after the tests are performed. 
                     That is NOT a problem!
     Just restart the plugin manager and you'll see the plug-in was installed. 
     This is an issue that will be tackled soon.
     
     You should be ready to run the testcases in $CRUSDE_HOME/testcases after that. 

7) I recommend to copy the testcases directory somewhere into your user space 
   so that other users have access to clean testcases. You can then go ahead
   and play with them:

    $> crusde <path to experiment definition>/experiment.xml



Copying, etc. (shamelessly copied from ncview's INSTALL file)
