GENERAL INFO / LICENSE
======================

CrusDe is a plug-in based simulation framework to study effects due to changes 
in the load resting on the Earth's surface. Such changes could for example 
involve a melting glacier, annual snow load, a reservoirs alternating water 
level, or lava flows. The focus in the simulation could be the response of 
the Earth's crust in terms of stress changes, changes in strain rate, or simply 
uplift or subsidence and the respective horizontal displacements of the crust 
(over time).

CrusDe is currently distributed under the terms of the GPLv2 license. That might
change in the future. CrusDe will, however, remain open source software. Whoever
does something and redistributes it has to include the sources for CrusDe and
the sources of the extentions / changes made.
