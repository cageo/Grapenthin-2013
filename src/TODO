Here are some things that need to be improved in CrusDe 
(numbers give relative importance 1=low, 10=high):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

2 omitting of region indicates that whole earth is to be modeled (only if GF=spherical)
4 add a flag that indicates whether a Green's function is for flat or spherical earth
6 add udunits package
5 implement intelligent gridding for model world:
	- that will not require an equally spaced input load grid
	- that will use the given grid size and actually massage the input load 
          in a way that will allow reasonable results.

1 remove all string constants from code and put them into separate header
1 implement option to have all values (all arrays etc) written to a log file
2 use look up table that's already started in pinel_thickplate.c
